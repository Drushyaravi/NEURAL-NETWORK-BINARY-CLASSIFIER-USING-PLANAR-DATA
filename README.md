# NEURAL-NETWORK-BINARY-CLASSIFIER-USING-PLANAR-DATA
=============================================

**Overview**
-----------
This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network binary classifier, designed to classify planar data into two categories. The classifier is trained using a dataset generated by the `make_moons` function from scikit-learn, which creates a binary classification problem with a non-linear decision boundary.

**Files**
--------
* `neural_network.py`: Contains the implementation of the neural network binary classifier.
* `main.py`: Example usage of the neural network classifier, including data loading, preprocessing, and training.

**Usage**
--------
### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-binary-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd neural-network-binary-classifier`
3. Run the example code: `python main.py`

### Data
The dataset used in this example is generated by the `make_moons` function from scikit-learn, which creates a binary classification problem with a non-linear decision boundary. The dataset consists of 1000 samples, with 2 features each.

### Model Architecture
The neural network model consists of the following layers:
* Input Layer: 2 neurons
* Hidden Layer: 4 neurons, with tanh activation
* Output Layer: 1 neuron, with sigmoid activation

### Training
The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.01, for 1000 epochs.

**Dependencies**
---------------
* **NumPy**: The code uses NumPy for numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib**: The code uses Matplotlib for plotting the data.
* **Scikit-learn**: The code uses scikit-learn for generating the dataset.
